## BLE.Client.UWP

very early version:

UWP app runs with the framework, Bluetooth is always _not available_.

### Technologies
1. MvvmCross 5

This is why this branch is not PR to original repo yet. I tried MvvmCross 4.4, but I just can't get it work with Xamarin.Forms on UWP

2. Xamarin.Froms

UI part for UWP. 
It's also shared from Android/iOS projects. See the screenshot.
